### swagger

The `swagger` options are fairly self explanatory. For more information, see the options for [fastify-swagger](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-swagger).

`swagger.basePath` sets a URL prefix for the documentation page when it forms service URLs. This is handy when you're using an Apache or Nginx proxy path rather than an A-name. For example, if you are proxying the services to `http://server.com/api`, you would set `swagger.basePath` to `"/api"`. Otherwise leave it set to `null`.
